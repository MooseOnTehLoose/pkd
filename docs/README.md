## docsify

> A magical DKP On-Premise Pre-Provisioned cluster generator

## What it is

Docsify generates your documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files. Instead, it smartly loads and parses your Markdown files and displays them as a website. To start using it, all you need to do is create an `index.html` and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](deploy.md).

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.

## Features

- No more exporting shell variables
- Single yaml file for all cluster configuration
- PodSubnet and ServiceSubnet CIDR customization
- Registry and GPU override integration
- N number of NodePools supported with NodePool specific overrides
- Separation of each object into its own yaml file to simplify manual editing
